Welcome to my thesis repository.

The pdf for my main report can be found at `latex/main.pdf`.

My haskell code can be found in `hs/libfusion`.
- You can run the code in list.lhs by executing `cabal run` from within `hs/libfusion`.
- You can run the code in leaf_trees.lhs by modifying line 62 of libfusion.cabal to point to leaf_trees.lhs and then execution `cabal run` from within `hs/libfusion`.

The Agda formalization can be found in `agda/`
- You can compile all of the code by compiling `agda/core.agda`

All of my notes and some of the pdfs I reference can be found in `hs/`

Happy reading :)
