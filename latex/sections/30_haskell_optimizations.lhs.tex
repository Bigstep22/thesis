\section{Haskell Optimizations}\label{sec:haskell}
In \cite{Harper2011}'s work there were still multiple open questions left regarding the exact mechanics of what Church and Cochurch encodings did while making their way through the compiler. Why are Cochurch encodings faster in some pipelines, but slower in others?

In this section I'll describe my work replicating the fused Haskell code of the \cite{Harper2011}'s work and further optimization opportunities that were discovered along the way.

I'll start off with the existing working code, followed by a discussion of the discoveries made throughout the process of writing, replicating, and further optimization of \cite{Harper2011}'s example code.
