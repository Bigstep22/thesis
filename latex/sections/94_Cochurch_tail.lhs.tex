\subsection{Cochurch Stream-fused tail-recursive encoding derivation}
I will present the \textit{idea} behind Church encodings:
\begin{spec}
data List'_ a b = Nil'_ | NilT'_ b | Cons'_ a b deriving Functor
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a) deriving (Functor, Show)
data ListCoCh a = forall s . ListCoCh (s -> List'_ a s) s

toCoCh :: List a -> ListCoCh a
toCoCh = ListCoCh out
out :: List a -> List'_ a (List a)
out Nil = Nil'_
out (Cons x xs) = Cons'_ x xs

fromCoCh :: ListCoCh a -> List a
fromCoCh (ListCoCh h s) = unfold h s
unfold :: (b -> List'_ a b) -> b -> List a
unfold h s = case h s of
  Nil'_ -> Nil
  NilT'_ xs -> unfold h xs
  Cons'_ x xs -> Cons x (unfold h xs)


fromCoCh . toCoCh l
-- Dfn of toCoCh
fromCoCh . ListCoCh out l
-- Dfn of fromCoCh
unfold out l
-- Dfn of unfold
case out l of
  Nil'_ -> Nil
  NilT'_ xs -> unfold out xs
  Cons'_ x xs -> Cons x (unfold out xs)
-- Dfn of out
case (case l of
  Nil -> Nil'_
  Cons x xs -> Cons'_ x xs
  ) of
  Nil'_ -> Nil
  NilT'_ xs -> unfold out xs
  Cons'_ x xs -> Cons x (unfold out xs)
-- Application of chained case statements
case l of
  Nil -> Nil
  Cons x xs -> Cons x (unfold out xs)
-- Function is same as id through induction.


toCoCh . fromCoCh (ListCoCh h s)
-- Unfold fromCoCh
toCoCh . unfold h s
-- Dfn of toCoCh
ListCoCh out (unfold h s)
-- ehhh, figure this out later. Proofs 3-5 of both Church and CoChurch encodings might be involved here...
-- And then it's all the same as id :).
-- I believe the proof idea can be found halfway through page 50.
\end{spec}
CoChurch encoded versions of sum, map (+2), filter odd, and between look like the following:
\begin{spec}
su' :: (s -> List'_ Int s) -> s -> Int
su' h s = loop s 0
  where loop s' acc = case h s' of
    Nil'_ -> acc
    NilT'_ xs -> loop xs acc
    Cons'_ x xs -> loop xs (x + acc)
sumCoCh :: ListCoCh Int -> Int
sumCoCh (ListCoCh h s) = su' h s

m' :: (a -> b) -> List'_ a c -> List'_ b c
m' f (Cons'_ x xs) = Cons'_ (f x) xs
m' _ (NilT'_ xs) = NilT'_ xs
m' _ (Nil'_) = Nil'_
mapCoCh :: (a -> b) -> ListCoCh a -> ListCoCh b
mapCoCh f (ListCoCh h s) = ListCoCh (m' f . h) s

filt p h s = case h s of
               Nil'_ -> Nil'_
               NilT'_ xs -> NilT'_ xs
               Cons'_ x xs -> if p x then Cons'_ x xs else NilT'_ xs
filterCoCh :: (a -> Bool) -> ListCoCh a -> ListCoCh a
filterCoCh p (ListCoCh h s) = ListCoCh (filt p h) s

betweenCoCh :: (Int, Int) -> List'_ Int (Int, Int)
betweenCoCh (x, y)
  | x > y = Nil'_
  | x <= y = Cons'_ x (x+1, y)
  | otherwise = Nil'_
\end{spec}
Next, the \textit{actual} functions:
\begin{spec}
sum :: List Int -> Int
sum = sumCoCh . toCoCh

map :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f = fromCoCh . mapCoCh f . toCoCh

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
filter p = fromCoCh . filterCoCh p . toCoCh

between :: (Int, Int) -> List Int
between = fromCoCh . ListCoCh betweenCoCh
\end{spec}
Remember the pipeline? Now it looks like this:
\begin{spec}
f = sum . map (+2) . filter odd . between

f =	     sumCoCh          . toCoCh .
fromCoCh . mapCoCh (+2)   . toCoCh .
fromCoCh . filterCoCh odd . toCoCh .
fromCoCh . ListCoCh betweenCoCh
\end{spec}
When 'fused' it looks like this:
\begin{spec}
sumCoCh . mapCoCh (+2) . filterCoCh odd . ListCoCh betweenCoCh
\end{spec}
