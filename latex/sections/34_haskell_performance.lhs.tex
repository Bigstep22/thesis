PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION


Throughout the development process I made use of the tool tastybench\footnote{\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench}} and analyzed the dumped core representation generated by GHC\footnote{\url{https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/debugging.html\#core-representation-and-simplification}}.
The process went through the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement List Church encoding
    \item Modify type to make the list `nullable', such that filter can be implemented as a natural transformation.
    \item Implement Leaf Tree Church encoding.
    \item Analyze core representation of (partially) fused list functions. Notice that (co)recursion principle for the function pipelines ends up being the recursion structure that ends up being represented in the Core repesentation.
    \item Modify sum function to be tail-recursive for Cochurch encodings. Notice 40\% speedup.
\end{itemize}
