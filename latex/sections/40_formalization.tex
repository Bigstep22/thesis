\section{Agda Formalization of the Optimization}\label{sec:formalization}
In \cite{Harper2011}'s work ``A Library Writer's Guide to Shortcut Fusion'', he describes the practice of implementing Church and Cochurch encodings, as well as a paper proof necessary to show that the encodings employed are correct.
I pose and answer the following question in this section:
Are the transformations used to enable fusion safe? Meaning:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Do the transformations in Haskell preserve the semantics of the language?
  \item If the mathematics and the encodings are implemented in a dependently typed language, is it possible to prove them to be correct?
\end{itemize}

In this section we discuss the work that was done to formalize Harper's proofs in the programming language Agda, as well as additional proofs to support the claims made in the paper.
My code is represented in roughly 3 parts, once for Church and once for Cochurch encodings, each part builds on the previous one:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item The proofs of the category theory properties, such as initiality/terminality of datatypes and the reflection property.
  \item The definition and proofs about the (Co)Church encodings, again as described by Harper.
  \item An example implementation of the list datatype, using containers.
\end{itemize}

The Agda code makes use of two libraries: agda-stdlib\footnote{\url{https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib}} v2.0 and agda-categories\footnote{\url{https://github.com/agda/agda-categories}} v0.2.0.

The discussion of my implementation can be found in \autoref{sec:agda_form_disc}

\subsection{Church Encodings}
\subsubsection{Category Theory: Initiality}\label{sec:agda_init}
This section is about my formalization of \cite{Harper2011}'s work that proves the needed category theory that is to be used later on in the (Co)Church part of the formalization.
This section specifically defines the category of F-Algebras and proves initiality of \tt($\mu$F, in') (the universal properties of folds) and the fusion property.

\subsubsection{Fusion: Church encodings}
This section focuses on the fusion of Church encodings, leveraging parametricity (free theorems) \citep{Wadler1989}.

\subsection{Cochurch Encodings}
\subsubsection{Category Theory: Terminality}
This section specifically defines the category of F-Coalgebras and proves terminality of \tt{$\nu$F, out} (the universal properties of unfolds) and the fusion property.
This section is the complement of \autoref{sec:agda_init}.

This section focuses on the fusion of Cochurch encodings, leveraging parametricity (free theorems) and the fusion property.
