\subsection{Common definitions}
Both the Church and Cochurch side use these definitions:
\input{sections/agda/funct/funext.tex}
This concludes the common definitions part of the Agda code, both the Church (initial) and Cochurch (terminal) halves of the formalization will use these definitions.

\subsection{Category Theory: Initiality}\label{sec:agda_init}
This section is about my formalization of \cite{Harper2011}'s work that proves the needed category theory that is to be used later on in the (Co)Church part of the formalization.
This section specifically defines the category of F-Algebras and proves initiality of \tt($\mu$F, in') (the universal properties of folds) and the fusion property.

\subsection{Category Theory: Terminality}
This section specifically defines the category of F-Coalgebras and proves terminality of \tt{$\nu$F, out} (the universal properties of unfolds) and the fusion property.
This section is the compliment of \autoref{sec:agda_init}.
