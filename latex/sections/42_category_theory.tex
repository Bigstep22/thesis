\subsection{Common definitions}
Both the Church and Cochurch side use these definitions:
\input{sections/agda/funct/funext.tex}
\input{sections/agda/funct/endo.tex}%
This concludes the common definitions part of the Agda code, both the forward (initial, Church) and backward (terminal, Cochurch) halves of the formalization will use these definitions.

\subsection{Category Theory: Initiality}
This section is about my formalization of \cite{Harper2011}'s work that proves the needed category theory that is to be used later on in the (Co)Church part of the formalization.
This module defines the category of F-Algebras and proves initiality of $\mu$ (the universal properties of folds) and the fusion property.
\input{sections/agda/init/initial.tex}
\input{sections/agda/init/fusion.tex}

\subsection{Category Theory: Terminality}
This module defines the category of F-Coalgebras and proves terminality of $\nu$ (the universal properties of unfolds) and the fusion property.
This module is the compliment of \tt{init}.
