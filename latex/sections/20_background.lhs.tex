\section{Background}
Before discussing the work that I have done, it is important to describe the necessary background.
My work builds on a body of existing work, namely foldr/build fusion \citep{Gill1993}, some category theory, Church encodings \citep{Harper2011}, Containers \citep{Abbott2005}, parametricity also known as free theorems \cite{Wadler1989}, and some optimizations in Haskell's optimization pipeline that are relevant for fusion.

I will be describing each of these works briefly.
After that, in the next sections, I will describe the work that I have done that builds on these topics.
