\section{Background}
Before discussing my work, it is important to describe the necessary background.
For the reader I assume familiarity with Agda and Haskell.
I also assume familiarity with the work of \cite{Harper2011}, it is recommended to have his work close at hand when reading mine; I do summarize parts of it, but I will not embed his work in mine.

My work builds on a body of existing work, namely foldr/build fusion and variants \citep{Gill1993,Svenningsson2002,Coutts2007}, some category theory \citep{Ahrens2022}, (Co)Church encodings \citep{Harper2011}, Containers \citep{Abbott2005}, parametricity (free theorems) \citep{Wadler1989}, and optimizations in Haskell's optimization pipeline that are relevant for fusion \citep{Jones1996}.
We will be describing some of these works briefly, others will be described when needed.
