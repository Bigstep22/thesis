\section{Background}
Before discussing my work, it is important to describe the necessary background.
My work builds on a body of existing work, namely foldr/build fusion and variants \citep{Gill1993,Svenningsson2002,Coutts2007}, some category theory \citep{Ahrens2022}, (Co)Church encodings \citep{Harper2011}, Containers \citep{Abbott2005}, parametricity (free theorems) \citep{Wadler1989}, and optimizations in Haskell's optimization pipeline that are relevant for fusion \citep{Jones1996}.

We will be describing each of these works briefly.
After that, in the next subsections, we will describe the work that I have done that builds on these topics.
Furthermore, for this thesis I assume familiarity with Agda and Haskell as well as Harper's work.
