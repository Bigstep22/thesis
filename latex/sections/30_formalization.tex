\section{Formalization}\label{sec:formalization}
In \cite{Harper2011}'s work ``A Library Writer's Guide to Shortcut Fusion'', the practice of implementing Church and CoChurch encodings is described, as well a paper proof necessary to show that the encodings optimizations employed are correct.

In this section the work I have done to formalize these proofs in the programming language Agda is discussed, as well as additional proofs to support the claims made in the paper.

The code can be neatly presented in roughly 2 parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The proofs of the category theory truths described by \cite{Harper2011}.
  \item The proofs about the (Co)Church encodings, again as described by \cite{Harper2011}.
\end{itemize}
