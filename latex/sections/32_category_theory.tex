\subsection{Category Theory Formalization}
This section is about my formalization of \cite{Harper2011}'s work that describes the needed category theory, to be leveraged later on in the fusion part of the formalization.
\subsubsection{init}
This module defines the category of F-Algebras, initiality of $\mu$, the universal properties of folds, and the fusion properties.

\input{sections/agda/init/fusion.tex}

\subsubsection{term}
This module defines the category of F-CoAlgebras, a candidate terminal object $\nu$, anamorphisms, proves terminality of $\nu$, the universal properties of unfolds, and the fusion properties.
This module is the compliment of \tt{init}.
