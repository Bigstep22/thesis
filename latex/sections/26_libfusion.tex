\subsection{Library Writer's Guide to Shortcut Fusion}
Now that the sufficient category theory has been explained, it is possible to describe \cite{Harper2011}'s paper, which my thesis centers on called ``A Library Writer's Guide to Shortcut Fusion''.


In the work, \cite{Harper2011} explain the concept of Church and CoChurch encodings in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explaining the mathematical background of Category theory, including F-algebras, initiality, Fusion, and universal properties.
    \item Explaining what encodings are and the proof obligations that are necessary to ensure correctness of the encodings.
    \item A pragmatic discussion of (Co)Church encodings that describes them using an example, with a performance analysis at the end.
\end{enumerate}
