One work that attempts to clearly explain a generalized form of \cite{Gill1993}'s work is ``A Library Writer's Guide to Shortcut Fusion'' by \cite{Harper2011}.


In the work, \cite{Harper2011} explain the concept of Church and CoChurch encodings in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explaining the mathematical background of Category theory, including F-algebras, initiality, Fusion, and universal properties.
    \item Explaining what encodings are and the proof obligations that are necessary to ensure correctness of the encodings.
    \item A pragmatic discussion of (Co)Church encodings that describes them using an example, with a performance analysis at the end.
\end{enumerate}
