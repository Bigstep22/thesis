\section{Conclusion and Future Work}



\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strengthen Agda's typechecker wrt implicit parameters
    \item Strengthen Agda's termination checker wrt corecursive datastructures
    \item Implement (co)church-fused versions of Haskell's library functions.
    \item Investigate if creating a language that has this fusion built-in natively can be compiled more efficiently
    \item Look into leveraging parametricity with agda, so no \tt{posulate}'s are needed.
\end{itemize}
