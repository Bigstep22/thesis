Questions bridging the gap between categorical fusion and (co)church encodings:
- What exacly is the $\phi$ in an F-Algebra, I'm struggling to wrap my head around it, again... (Is it a build?)
- We have your run-of-the mill fusion of initial algebras
- Starting off, how would we bridge this to the foldr/build fusion?
- How does that bridge over to (or relate to) church encodings? (Impredicative encodings?)
