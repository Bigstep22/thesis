Overview of weaknesses:
- Postulates:
	- funext (here to stay)
	- Free theorems (here to stay)
	- $\nu$Ext (ETA doesn't seem to work)
	- coherence
		- currently postulated 'in general'
		- in general, this is false
		- A definition for natural transformations needs to be constricted such that coherence only holds for them and can be proven.
		- [x] I'm wondering about ways in which this can be encoded...
	- fusion initial (requires cat.)
		- I'm worried about if the encodings, using containers, and the encodings of categories will end up being compatible for this, is this an issue that is encountered when combining maths in this way? If so, how is this usually resolved?
	- fusion terminal (requires cat.)
- Non-termination
	- reflexivity for anamorphism
- Type in type
	- None! :)

Writing:
- Nothing of significance yet.


For the coming week:
- Writing
- Getting the needed agda-cats code transplanted over:
	- categories
	- products
		- initiality
	- coproducts
		- terminality
	- functors
- Look into defining lists with containers
