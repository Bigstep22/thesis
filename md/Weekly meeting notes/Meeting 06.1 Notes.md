Next steps:
- Can I implement the example of the first page in Agda, and prove that the optimized version is the same as the original composition?
- Rewrite rules over lambdas are needed and might need to be postulated.
- See if maybe you can do this by the first-stage review.

Look into options for category theory libraries, after doing the example.
- Containerizing may be a good next step to get away from the consistency check disabling flags.
-

Perhaps take a look for an external thesis advisor, then we'd be sorted for the committee

Also present: What is the objective, what is the problem, why is it interesting? What are the milestones in the project? What my question that I'm trying to answer? Why is this problem unsolved?

The question and angle might also motivate the next steps.
