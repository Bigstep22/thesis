Planning of the thesis:
- Research that needs to be done?
	- Agda encoding and proof of the paper?
	- What level of detail? Are there cat. theory libraries already available?
	- Agda2hs for implementing optimizations?
- Start implementation of fusion for the Free monad.
	- Benchmarking tools?

What do you know about writing generator code for `deriving`?
What do you know about fusion techniques in Haskell? Any pointers?


Is there a good set date that we can agree on for the weekly meetings?
Any good standard structure that we know of for oncoming meetings?
Recommendations for research and note taking system for easing the writing process?

What in god's name is record syntax, why does it exist, and is there a non-ugly analogue for it?
