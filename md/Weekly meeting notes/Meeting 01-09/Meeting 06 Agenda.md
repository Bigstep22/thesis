A breakthrough week:
- Implemented the proof of page 51.
- Implemented the structure of proof of page 52
- Yet to finish the definition of an 'initial algebra'
- In general more cat. theory stuff can be included first.
- Strip away the postulates to a different file, and start proving lower-level parts of the category theory.

Questions:
- How should I define the anamorphisms
- Recommendations as to implementing the cat. in Agda
- Things to prep for for the pre-first-stage evaluation moment.
	- Maybe do some research as to if there is already a formalization of the paper out there
- Writing: How should I phrase my questions? I'm formalizing something
- How to express initiality? Provide proofs of the necessary properties and then you get $\mu$?
- 

Coming up:
- TBD during the meeting.
