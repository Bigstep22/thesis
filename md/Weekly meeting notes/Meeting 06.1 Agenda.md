# Meeting with Casper and Jaro, pre-first-stage review meeting.
First, let's show off what I've got :)

What did we agree again for the first-stage review?
- In my notes: Agda proof, motivating example of a haskell Fused Free monad program, and small presenation about the current working state and any lessons/hurdles I encountered.
- (optional) I'd like have done some research and also write out an outline/first-draft.

Thinking about after the first-stage review:
- Do I pursue Haskell further or,
- Do I pursue the proof further down to its categorical foundations
- (Or both?)

Thesis-organisational stuff
- Daily supervisor/co-supervisor roles?
- Jesper said yes!
- Thesis comittie.
- I've turned in my DCO, but I'd like my grade for the lit-survey as well so I have my full 75.
- My planning for the greenlight and defense.

Anything else:
- Free theorems, what do you know about them? I don't want to accidentally go into the weeds.
