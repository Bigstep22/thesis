It is very important to read further on sigma types and existential types.
- For sigma types, they come down to a dependent pair, see toVec from List to Vec as an example.
- In terms of containers:


For next week:
- Play with the notation of containers: What happens when I add a value to the branching case? And/Or remove the leaf case? Play with it!
- Containerize the code!
- make an example program.
- Fix your type levels now that you have defined stuff
- Justify your use of postulates/make a roadmap for how I'll get rid of them.
