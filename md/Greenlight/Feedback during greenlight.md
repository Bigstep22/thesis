Quality of work
- Seems like novelty
- Method seems good, right tools for job
- Application or development of theory is clear
- Interpretation of results: NEED TO SEE IT IN REPORT.

- Give basic explanations, so they have an intution, but not the technical level.
- Examples are very useful in these contexts.
