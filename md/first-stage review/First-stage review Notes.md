# Overview of current proof and postulates:
- Use size types, or 

## Postulates:
- Good, get to it :)

## Termination-check disable:
- Use the TERMINATING pragma

# How does this fit into the big picture?
- 

## How does church-encoded fusion work?
- Big question about why the definition was different.

Next steps:
- First contribution is done, but not quite.
	- Remove more postulates.
- I could use agda cats, recommended by Benedikt
- You only need two or three definitions.
	- It's something you could do in an afternoon.
Another possiblity:
- It might be interesting to know what happens to universe levels. Essentially to get rid of type-in-type
- Give it a shot!
- Look at the paper referenced by Benedikt.

(When time is there) Start working with Haskell more:
- Investigate further why Church/CoChurch encodings are faster sometimes.
